This README outlines the implementation of a fine-tuned GPT-2 model for a question-and-answer task and the creation of a chatbot.

(1) Loading the Model - GPT-MEDIUM.py
The first code snippet in GPT-MEDIUM.py is responsible for loading the GPT-2 Medium model and its tokenizer.

Model Initialization: The code uses the GPT2Tokenizer and GPT2LMHeadModel classes from the transformers library to load the pre-trained GPT-2 model. It specifies "gpt2-medium" as the model to load, ensuring that the model is set up correctly for the task at hand.

Padding Token: The end-of-sequence token is set as the padding token to ensure that the model handles variable-length input sequences properly during training.

Device Configuration: The model is configured to utilize a GPU if available, enhancing performance during computation. This setup allows for faster processing and training times.

(2) Fine-Tuning the Model - finetuning.py
The second code snippet in finetuning.py is dedicated to fine-tuning the GPT-2 model using a custom dataset of question-answer pairs.

Dataset Class: A class named QADataset is defined to handle the loading and processing of questions and answers. The constructor takes a file path to a JSON file containing the dataset, a tokenizer, and a maximum length for tokenization.

JSON File Structure: The dataset is expected to be in JSON format, structured as an array of objects, each containing a "prompt" (the question) and a "response" (the corresponding answer). For example:

json

[
    {"prompt": "What is the Luminary Stone?", "response": "The Luminary Stone grants wisdom and strength to those who find it."},
    {"prompt": "Who is Elara?", "response": "Elara is a young girl who ventures into the Whispering Woods."}
]
Tokenization: The questions and answers are concatenated into a single input string formatted as "Question: {prompt}\nAnswer: {response}". The tokenizer converts this text into input IDs and attention masks suitable for training the model.

Training Configuration: The code sets the training parameters, including the output directory for saving the fine-tuned model, batch size, number of training epochs, and logging configurations. The Trainer class from the transformers library is utilized to facilitate the training process.

(3) Implementing the Chatbot - output.py
The third code snippet, referred to as output.py, implements a simple chatbot interface using the fine-tuned model.

Loading the Fine-Tuned Model: The chatbot script loads the fine-tuned model (fine_tuned_qa_model) and the corresponding tokenizer, making it ready to generate responses to user queries.

Chat Functionality: The chat function initiates a loop where the user can input questions. The model generates answers based on the input, providing a dynamic interaction experience.

Exit Mechanism: Users can terminate the chat by typing "exit", which gracefully ends the interaction and thanks the user.

Conclusion
This README covers the essential components for loading, fine-tuning, and utilizing a GPT-2 model for a question-and-answer task. The structured JSON dataset and the implementation of a chatbot interface provide a complete solution for interactive question answering based on a narrative context.
